# Test Users & Feedback Process

## Getting 1–3 Test Users

Suggested message to send:

"Hey, I am testing an app I am building called AuraAI. It analyzes your chat conversations (like texts with a partner) and shows the overall vibe, emotional tone, and key patterns.

Would you be willing to test it for 5–10 minutes and tell me what confused you or felt off?

Here is the link: <PASTE AURAAI URL>

If you try it, I would love to know:
1) What you expected the app to do before you used it.
2) What parts were confusing or annoying.
3) Whether the results felt accurate or useful."

## Mini Feedback Questions

Ask each tester:

1. On a scale of 1–10, how easy was it to understand what to do?
2. Where did you get stuck or confused?
3. Did the analysis feel at least somewhat accurate?
4. What is the first thing you would change?

## Feedback → Fix Workflow

1. Collect
   - Keep all feedback in one doc or note.
   - Include: who said it, date, and exact quote.

2. Tag
   - BUG – something broken or error.
   - UX – confusing layout, wording, or flow.
   - FEATURE – request for new capability.

3. Prioritize
   1) Fix bugs that block core flows (auth, new analysis, view result).
   2) Fix UX issues mentioned by more than one tester.
   3) Then do small improvements (copy, spacing, polish).

4. Fix Cycle

- Pick 1–3 items.
- Fix them in code.
- Redeploy.
- Ask at least one tester to try again and confirm that the same confusion is gone.
